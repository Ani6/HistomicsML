HistomicsML
===========

HistomicsML is an interactive machine-learning system for analyzing whole-slide imaging digital pathology datasets.

HistomicsML software is designed to run on a server system, and provides a convenient web based interface that allows experts to interact with whole-slide imaging datasets and image analysis metadata to train and validate classification rules to identify microanatomic objects in histopathology. HistomicsML uses data generated by image segmentation and feature extraction algorithms applied to whole-slide images that identify objects like cell nuclei and that objectively quantify their appearance. HistomicsML presents this data to users through a web-interface that allows them to interact with machine-learning algorithms to train classification rules that identify objects of interest. It provides interfaces for classifier training, loading data, exporting results, generating ground-truth validation data, and collaborative review of training and ground-truth annotations.
